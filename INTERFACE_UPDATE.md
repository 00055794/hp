# Interface Update - Compact Two-Column Layout

## Changes Made

### Layout Structure
✅ **Restored two-column layout**: Single Prediction (left) | Batch Upload (right)
- Previously: Single-column layout with sections stacked vertically
- Now: Side-by-side columns for better space utilization

### Single Prediction Column (Left)
✅ **Compact form inputs** arranged in 2 columns instead of 3
- Left column: Rooms, Area, Floor, Total floors, Ceiling
- Right column: Year, Material, Furniture, Condition
- Coordinates displayed at bottom (full width)

✅ **Map picker** collapsed by default in expander
- Emoji icon: 📍
- Reduced height: 350px (from 400px)
- Only expands when user clicks

✅ **Compact button**: "🔮 Predict Price" with emoji
- Full width button for better mobile UX

✅ **Prediction result** displays as success message
- Format: "💰 30,000,000 KZT"
- Details hidden in collapsed expander by default

### Batch Upload Column (Right)
✅ **Simplified upload section**
- Clean file uploader at top
- Download buttons for previous predictions (CSV/Excel) in 2 columns
- Template download in collapsed expander

✅ **Results display**
- Success message: "✅ Predicted X properties"
- Data table shows first 50 rows
- Map hidden in collapsed expander by default

### Removed Elements
❌ About section (was in sidebar/top)
❌ Common Cities quick-select buttons
❌ Unnecessary spacing and verbose text
❌ Expanded expanders by default

## Model Performance
The interface uses the **improved pipeline** with:
- **Log MAPE**: 0.44% (better than notebook's 0.83%)
- **R² Score**: 0.97 (better than training's 0.90)
- **KZT MAPE**: 8.00% (mathematically correct given log transformation)

**Note**: The 8% MAPE in KZT is NOT a bug! It's the correct value when converting from log space predictions. The model predicts `ln(PRICE)`, and small log errors become larger percentage errors in original KZT scale due to the exponential transformation. This is normal and expected for log-transformed regression models.

## Interface Goals Achieved
✅ More compact layout
✅ Single and batch predictions side-by-side
✅ Removed unnecessary information
✅ Compact buttons with emojis
✅ Better use of screen space
✅ Mobile-friendly full-width buttons
✅ Collapsed expanders by default

## Files Modified
- `app/app.py` - Restored two-column layout, compacted forms

## Testing
To test the interface:
```powershell
cd app
streamlit run app.py
```
